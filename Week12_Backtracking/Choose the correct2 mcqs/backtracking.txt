Problem statement
Why is recursion preferred in backtracking algorithms?


Options: Pick one correct answer from below
• It allows for the use of global variables.
• It naturally fits the problem of exploring all possible solutions in a tree-like structure, allows breaking down problems into smaller subproblems,
  narrows down the solution space, and makes the implementation easier.
• It simplifies the code by avoiding the use of loops.
• It prevents stack overflow errors.
